    "#  Write a function named is_stack_sorted accepts a list of integers as a parameter and treats it as a stack, \n",
    "# returning True if the elements in the stack occur in ascending (non-decreasing) order from bottom (end) to top (front), else False. \n",
    "#  This essentially means that you are checking whether the list is in reverse-sorted order. \n",
    "# An empty or one-element stack is considered to be sorted. \n",
    "# For example, if passed the following stack, your function should return True:\n",

    "# You should treat the list as a stack and not use any index-related operations on it. \n",
    "# This means that the only operations you should use on the list are the pop and append functions and the len function. \n",
    "# You should not use the [] indexing operator nor any other operations that depend on accessing various elements by index. \n",
    "# You also should not use a for-each loop over the stack's elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When your function returns, the stack should be in the same state as when it was passed in. \n",
